== Description ==

This plugin is designed to be used by UK schools using the OpenCheck service found at http://opencheck.atomwide.com. In those instances where staff and parents are using the ParentComms mobile app to subscribe to notifications regarding school status via OpenCheck, this plugin will allow schools using WordPress to send their latest posts as push notifications directly to subscribers' mobile apps free of charge. Schools can choose to send a post out to staff only or to all ParentComms users associated subscribing to the school to help improve communication and encourage parental engagement.
